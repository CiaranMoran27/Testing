## Introduction
This README file gives a more in-depth explanation of the code used to complete the weekly tasks for the 2021<br/>Programming and Scripting GMIT module as part of the Higher Diploma in Science in Computing.  
<br/>


## Task 1: (Bmi.py):
*Write a program that calculates somebody's Body Mass Index (BMI). The inputs are the person's height in centimetres<br/>and weight in kilograms. The output is their weight divided by their height in metres squared.* 
<br/>
<br/>

### Code:
``` Python
height = float(input("What is your height in centimetres?:"))
weight = float(input("What is your weight kilograms?:"))
metres_sq = (height/100)**2
bmi = round(weight / metres_sq,2)
print("BMI is " + str(bmi) + ' kg/m²')
```
<br/>


### Code breakdown:
- User is asked for their height(cm) and weight(Kg).
- Height is convered from cm to m² and stored in *metres_sq* variable.
- Weight(Kg) is divided by height(m²), rounded to two decimal places and passed to *bmi* variable.
- The bmi result is passed into a {} placeholder via string formatting and printed.
